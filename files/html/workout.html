          well as your triceps and shoulders. Lie on a flat bench with your feet
          flat on the ground and grip the barbell with your hands slightly wider

          exercise is similar to the barbell bench press, but it allows for a
          greater range of motion and can help you work each side of your chest
          independently. Lie on a flat bench with your feet flat on the ground
          and hold a dumbbell in each hand. Lower the dumbbells to your chest,
          pause briefly, and then press them back up to the starting position.

          shoulder-width apart. Lower your body until your chest touches the

        <p>
          <img class="gif" src="../images/leg01.gif" />Leg extensions are a popular
          gym exercise that focus on strengthening the muscles in the front of
          your thighs, specifically the quadriceps.It's important to use a
          weight that is challenging but manageable for you, and to avoid
          locking your knees or using momentum to lift the weight. Start with a
          lighter weight and focus on good form, gradually increasing the weight
          as you get stronger. You can also do single-leg extensions, lifting
          one leg at a time, to add more challenge and balance work.

          feet, squeezing your calves at the top of the movement. Lower back
          down and repeat for the desired number of reps.
